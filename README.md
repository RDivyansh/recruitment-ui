# Recruitment Frontend (Demo)
This is a frontend-only demo of the recruitment portal with an elegant black+red theme.
It uses mock data and requires no backend to run.

## Run locally
1. Install deps: `npm ci`
2. Run dev: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Publish to Vercel (fast)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
2. Sign up / log in to Vercel and import the repo.
3. Vercel will detect Next.js and deploy automatically.
4. Share the generated URL (https://<your-app>.vercel.app).

## Notes
- This is frontend-only and uses demo/mock data in `src/data/jobs.ts`.
- To connect to a backend later, replace data imports with API calls.
